# "**Test App**" REST API backend

## Create project

```
# redirect to your Desktop or projects folder
cd Desktop

# create a folder
sudo mkdir test_app

# move to that folder
cd test_app

# create a project
npm init
```

Give your project a name i.e. **Test App**

Press just enter, enter, enter until you crete the project. We will create necessary files later. Now open your **test_app** folder with **Visual Studio Code**. Open the **Terminal** window from top left corner of Visual Studio Code.

We need to install **Express** framework which will help us to create REST APIs with Node.js

```
npm install express
```

Install **nodemon** plugin. This plugin will help us to test our backend server very fast! It will restart the server everytime when we make any change/edit.

```
npm install nodemon
```

We will need another plugin.

```
sudo npm install multer
```

Excellent! Now follow the video tutorial!
